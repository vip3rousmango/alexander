Hi, I'm Al Romano.

I'm a Web Stack Developer with a knack for web analytics, data visualization and accessable dashboards.
I'm a firm believer of "user experience first" and HTML First Prototyping approaches when
applying best practice standards for web development and passonate about includsive development.

Starting out as a PHP (LAMP) developer (you guessed it, WordPress...) I've recently taken
an interest in Information Dashboard design and data visualization with a focus on web accesability using JavaScript
as well as becoming more proficient using Node.js both for pipeline and for building applications (MExN/CLIs).

I have worked for international ad agencies like Saatchi & Saatchi and Upcoming Media,
local bioinformatics software Cyclica and am currently helping the cause at SickKids Foundation.
